# Team Agreement

Like all dynamic systems, teams have life-cycles. It is important to consider the strategies and tools leaders use to support effective functioning at a team's various stages. When launching a team, we often spend time planning what to do and forget to establish how we want to work together to support our collective objectives. 

Collaborative planning is a framework designed to initiate a conversation that helps transition a team from individual orientations to that of a collective. It helps develop a shared understanding and accountability for how you want to work together to best leverage your individual preferences, strengths, and goals towards an innovative joint outcome. Your collaborative plan is a dynamic repository of your shared agreements that you can refer to and update as you learn more about each other and the project.
